# `cpp-calculator`

üç© A basic command-line calculator written in C++.

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and roots-based calculations.

**NOTE:** This is one of my very first programs with C++, so the code is probably faulty and can be improved. :) I believe the best way to learn new technologies is by doing, which I why I created this simple calculator in C++ as a way to try out the language!
